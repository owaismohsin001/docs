Here’s a deeper dive into the situation and some steps to mitigate the AWS keys exposure:

### **Scenario Analysis**
1. **Keys in the Dockerfile**:
   - **Risk**: If sensitive keys were hardcoded into the Dockerfile, anyone with access to the repository could view them. This risk is particularly high for public repositories or poorly secured private ones.
   - **Solution**:
     - Move sensitive data to **GitHub Secrets**.
     - Update your workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) to inject these secrets at runtime using the secrets manager.
     - Use environment variables for runtime access rather than hardcoding values.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Build Docker image
         run: docker build -t app .
         env:
           AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
           AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
   ```

2. **ECR Image Accessibility**:
   - **Risk**: If ECR images are accessible via a public URL and permissions aren’t properly configured, anyone with the URL can pull the image. A determined attacker might inspect the image layers and extract sensitive information (e.g., keys).
   - **Solution**:
     - **Restrict access**:
       - Ensure your ECR repository policy is configured to allow only authorized IAM roles to pull images. Avoid public repository configurations unless absolutely necessary.
     - **Encryption**:
       - Use AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to encrypt your images in ECR.
       - Rotate your KMS keys regularly.
       - Enable private endpoint access for ECR to keep communication within your VPC.

     Example repository policy to restrict access:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
             "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
           },
           "Action": "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:repository/REPO_NAME"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### **General Mitigation Steps**

1. **Audit and Rotate Keys**:
   - Immediately **revoke and rotate** the exposed keys.
   - Audit the logs in **AWS CloudTrail** for any unauthorized usage of the exposed keys.

2. **Use IAM Roles**:
   - Use IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials where possible. For instance:
     - Assign an IAM role to App Runner to allow it to pull ECR images.
     - Use **AssumeRole** patterns for temporary access if other services require credentials.

3. **Scan the Repository**:
   - Use tools like **git-secrets** or **TruffleHog** to scan your GitHub repository for exposed keys.
   - Check for leaked keys in your Docker image layers.

4. **Monitor and Alerts**:
   - Set up AWS **CloudWatch Alarms** or other monitoring tools to alert you on unauthorized access or downloads from ECR.
   - Consider implementing a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to mitigate future risks.

5. **Educate Your Team**:
   - Train developers on best practices for handling sensitive credentials and secrets.
   - Conduct a security review of your CI/CD pipeline.

### **Future Best Practices**
- Leverage tools like **AWS Secrets Manager** or **HashiCorp Vault** for managing sensitive data.
- Employ **immutable infrastructure principles** to minimize secrets’ persistence.
- Consider using **service-linked roles** with minimal permissions required for App Runner and ECR interactions.
